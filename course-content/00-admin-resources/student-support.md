[Back to top](#student-support)

Tutoring Sessions will be made available to you if needed.

These sessions require that you have turned in homework and are in good standing with your attendance.

**How the system works:**

1) If you are interested in tutoring, you can find a chat window within BootcampSpot to request a tutor. You must also meet the attendance and homework requirements ( No more than 4 missed classes and no more than 2 missed homework assignments)

2) Once you have communicated your desire for a tutor through BootcampSpot the Student will receive an email with their assigned tutor 24-48 hours.Student will need to schedule their first session 24-48 hours after receiving email. 

Steps: 

**Step ONE** Log into BCS, on the main page click the support button on the nav bar.

 <div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/images/tutoring/tutor-step-01.jpg" alt="icon" width="400"></div>

**Step TWO** From the drop down choose “I am a student” and “Tutor Request”. In the text box include topics you’d like support with along with your Github username. 

  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/images/tutoring/tutor-step-02.jpg" alt="icon" width="400"></div>

**Step THREE** You will receive an email from Central Supports within 24-48 hours connecting you to your assigned tutor!




#### Tutoring Details
[Back to top](#student-support)

**Keep in mind any time zone differences. Please make sure to discuss it with your tutor.  This issue has created a few missed sessions in the past.**

**Sessions should be 60 minutes in length. Twice a week via a video using google hangouts.**

4) At the end of each session discuss scheduling the next session.  

5) Both the tutor and the student are **required** to fill out an evaluation form after EACH session.  Data is very important to the ongoing success of Central Support.  **Every tutor assignment email has the link to the Student’s Evaluation Form.**

* **If a student No-Shows to a session, the student may not be eligible for tutoring in the future.**

* **If student needs to change the appointment communicate with your tutor immediately.**

##### Learning Assistant Service Expectations

> Learning Assistants strive to provide a path forward for students in under 30 minutes. Response and resolution times will vary, as service demands fluctuate throughout the day.
Students should only ask questions when they have the time to dedicate to working with an LA. 

> If a student goes unresponsive for 30 minutes, their question will be automatically closed. The student will need to ask their question again, entering at the back of the queue.

##### How to Use AskBCS

*Step 1 - Login to Slack*

> Log in to your cohort's Slack Workspace. In the left sidebar, you will see a dropdown labeled​ `Apps.` Click the sidebar and select ​AskBCS Learning Assistant

*Step 2 - Home Screen Navigation*

> You are now at the Homescreen. Here you can ask a new question, view your open, and previously asked questions. To submit a new question, click the ​`Ask a Question ?` ​button on the top of the screen

*Step 3 - Question Form*

> Clicking the ​`Ask a Question ?`​ button will trigger a pop-up to open. Here you can write out your question. Please provide as much detail as possible.​ (If you need to add additional information, you will be able to later)


*Step 4 - Submit Your Question*

> Click ​`Submit,`​ your question will be submitted to the Learning Assistants’ queue. A new private channel will be created in the left sidebar of your cohort’s workspace. This newly created private channel is where you will communicate with the LA, once they claim your question. This will allow you to chat privately with the learning assistant. Your conversation will not be visible to other students.

*Step 5 - Navigate to the Conversation*

> Navigate to the newly created private channel. You can navigate there by clicking on the channel in the left sidebar​ or the ​`View Question`​ Button under the ​`My Open Questions’ ​section`.

*Step 6 - Add additional Information*

> Navigate to the newly created private channel. Here you can add supplemental information for your question. You can include attachments, screenshots, and use rich-text formatting as well.

*Step 7 - LA Support*

> Once claimed, you will be greeted by an LA who will work with you to clarify misunderstandings and help you find the answer to your question. You can communicate back and forth with the LA.

*Step 8 - Resolution*

> Once the question has been answered, the LA will close the question. You will be prompted to give feedback on the LA’s service. After your question is closed, you will no longer be able to communicate with the LA.

*(Optional) Step 10 - Ask Another Question*

> If you have another question, navigate back to the home tab and submit a new question. Your most recent question will be added to your ​`My Latest Resolved Questions`​ section.


*(Optional) Step 9 - Feedback*

> After providing feedback on the LA’s service, you can provide additional feedback about the rating you chose.

Asking the right questions 

> Asking the right type of question is key to becoming a developer. It’s a skill you will utilize every day in all aspects of the job. Asking great questions will not only clarify misunderstandings, it will also allow the Learning Assistants to address additional issues or provide additional resources to you.

Great Questions  

>Great questions provide 3 points for the Learning Assistants to address, What, Why, and How.

```
What is my question?
Why am I asking this question?
How do I implement this concept/idea?
