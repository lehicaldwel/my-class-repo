### Plagiarism vs. Collaboration

You Can ...
1. Pseudocode Together / Map Out a Plan of Attack in Non-Code Terms
2. Share small code snippets with your peers and have them assist with de-bugging to act as an example but not to be used directly. 
3. Don't use code that is not your original work. 



#### Follow These Simple Rules


1. Pseudocode Together / Map Out a Plan of Attack in Non-Code Terms
    > Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudocode typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations, system-specific code and some subroutines.

2. Type Every Line of Code Yourself

    > It is our expectation that you have typed every line of code. If asked, you are expected to be able to articulate the reasoning, benefits, drawbacks, experimentation failures, and successes to the choices you made and they way you expressed those choices in code.

    > When experimenting with examples posted online be sure to utilize it as a tool for learning not as a simple fix to the issue. You should attempt to understand the example in context, understand the example as it may apply to your situation, digest the take-aways, and then apply those lessons to your needs.


3. Code in a Cleanroom

    >Writing in a cleanroom is a process through which you physically separate outside text from you own. You can and should take similar precautions with your code, never mingling outside code with your work unless you've properly cited it.

4. Comment Your Code Thoroughly

    >Every programming language as a means of inserting comments into code and thoroughly commenting code is a good practice every programmer should follow. However, it is doubly important when incorporating outside code into your work, as comments are a simple way to illustrate what is and is not original. It's also useful if your instructors have any question about whether you wrote the code as good comments can illustrate a thorough understanding of what was written.

5. Use Original Variable Names

    > Then possible, ensure that your variable, class and other names are original. To be clear, simply changing variable names on copied code does NOT make it original but having unique and meaningful variable names not only makes coding easier for you, but also highlights that the work is yours.

6. Commit Often

    >It is expected that you make frequent and meaningful git commits throughout the entirety of your assignments. We expect that you have a minimum of 10 commits per assignment, that those commits are made progressively between the assigned day and the due date, and that each commit represents a proportional contribution to what will be your final submission.

    >Simply stated - we will not accept work that is composed of one commit representing the entirety of submission. 



### Plagiarism on Homework

#### First Strike

> Instructional Staff, student, and SSM collectively reevaluate your goals for the course.

>Student has option for this to be an assignment they do not complete. Assignment marked as “Incomplete” in BCS.

> Student has option to redo / complete assignment with 100% their own original work within one week.

#### Second Strike

> Instructional Staff, student, and SSM collectively reevaluate your goals for the course.

> Student  immediately receives a grade of an "F" on assignment.

#### Third Strike

> Instructional Staff, student, and SSM collectively conduct a **final** reevaluate the students goals for the course and student is presented with the taking the course as an **active non participant**.

### Plagiarism on Projects


#### First Strike

> The student should work individually on make up project.

> Students should have 3 weeks to redo the project

#### Second Strike

> Instructional Staff, student, and SSM collectively conduct a **final** reevaluate the students goals for the course and student is presented with the taking the course as an **active non participant**.

#### Third Strike

> No Third Strike

### Design UI/UX Mirroring

> It should be the aim of all students to generate their own unique wireframe that utlimatly informs the final design and layout of your site (homework & Project Work).

> Any Design Mirroring should be noted for: 

* Crediting the original Designer

* For your instructional staff to review for approval
