### Communication Steps as an `Interviewee`


1. **Clarify** 

> Start by repeating the problem back to the interviewer and ask any clarifying questions and test assumptions about the problem. Request a sample input and expected output if one is not given. 

<hr>  

2. **Inputs/Outputs** 

> Talk through the following: Given a set of inputs what are expected outputs for the problem? 

<hr>  

3. **Test & Edge Cases** 

> Inquire about any edge cases. 

Example: 

* Single character / Empty string
* Empty array
* Negative Numbers

>Write down at least one original concrete test case - you will be using this test case to walk your interviewer through your Pseudocode. 

<hr>  

4. **Naive Solution**

>Start with pseudo/coding the most obvious/naive solution, and let interviewer know this is where you are starting. Remember to talk through your process out loud, and if you get stuck prompt your interviewer for feedback or hints.

For each step of your algorithm you should make the following items clear: 

1. What are you going to do?
2. How are you going to do it? 
3. Why are you going to do it? 


<hr>  

5. **Reach an agreement**

> Only once you and your interviewer are both clear on what your intentions are, communicated with Pseudocode, do you begin to code. 

<hr>  

6. **Code It Out** 

> You will be coding it out on a whiteboard. No autocompletes, no syntax highlighting. Be sure to pay attention to the details and to utilizing proper style guides and conventions. 

While this is considered a `coding interview` this last section, the coding section, is actually the least important. While you should be mindful of syntax and naming convention the interviewer is primarily interested in your technical knowledge, ability to model problems in your head, and the clear communication of said model. 

Your Goal at the coding stage: 

a. Follow the Pseudocode.
b. Be mindful of syntax and naming convention.
c. Focus on clarity and communication (proper / indicative variable and function names).
