# MERN

## Overview

This week, you will use your skills in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to develop the tools needed to build a full-stack MERN app.

You’ll use React Router to make the application behave more like a multi-page application, allowing users to bookmark URLs and use the browser’s forward and back buttons. You’ll also add GraphQL, an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs that lets you fetch only the data you want from the database when you need it. Finally, you’ll learn how to use a JSON Web Token, or JWT, to add authentication to your site. 

During the next unit, we build on our full-stack app development skills as we learn about state management and the Context API. We will also review the key concepts covered in this unit to help you prepare for your final project


## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/)

* [GraphQL Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)

* [Resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/resolvers/)

* [Query parameters](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/)

* [Mutations](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/)

* [useMutation Hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/mutations/)

* [useQuery Hook](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/queries/)

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

* [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction)

* [Authentication in GraphQL API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/authentication/)

* [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Define a GraphQL schema and implement resolvers to handle data population.

* Write a GraphQL query to read data with and without parameters.

* Use a GraphQL mutation to create and update data.

* Execute queries and mutations using `useQuery()` and `useMutation()` Hooks.

* Update GraphQL's in-memory cache.

* Implement client-side routing by using React Router.

* Securely transmit data as a JSON object using JWT.

* Implement server-side authentication in GraphQL API.
