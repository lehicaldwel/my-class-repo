# React

## Overview

In this unit, you will learn how to create a single-page application (SPA) using React. React is a powerful and elegant technology, as well as a very in-demand skill to have as a web developer. As you create your SPA, you will learn how to use React components, manage application state, and pass data throughout your app. You'll get a sense for how React works under the hood and the problems it solves in modern web development. By the end of this unit, you will be one step closer to being employer-ready.
