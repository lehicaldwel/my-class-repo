# React State

## Overview
In this unit, we will work with complex state management techniques and review the key tools needed to build a MERN-stack app with routing and authentication. 


## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Context.Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider)

* [Context.Consumer](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextconsumer)

* [Redux reducers](https://redux.js.org/faq/reducers/)

* [Redux actions](https://redux.js.org/faq/actions/)

* [useReducer React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

* [useState React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

* [JWT authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction)

* [GraphQL type definitions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/schema/#object-types)

* [Stripe payment platform](https://stripe.com/docs)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Pass and store data down a React component tree using the Context API `Provider`.

* Consume data passed between components using the Context API `Consumer`.

* Implement Redux to manage state in a React application.

* Implement local and global state with the `useReducer` Hook.

* Describe the functionality of the `StoreProvider` component.

* Identify use cases for complex state management tools including the Context API and Redux. 

* Implement the Stripe payment platform in a MERN application.
