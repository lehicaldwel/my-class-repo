### How to use slack

##### Asking Questions: 

Within the `#techincal-questions` or `#homework` channel post your question with the following information:

1. What is the issue you are encountering? 
2. What have you attempted?
3. What are the errors (if any) that you are receiving?
4. Attach any screen shots that are relevant.
5. Link to your Github repo or code snippet with latest code

### Channels
Channels are the main source of group communication in Slack. There are two kinds: privaet and public.

#### Public channels
Public Channels are indicated by the `#` symbol. You will find them on the navbar located on the left-hand side of Slack (both online and on the desktop app). As inidicated by the name, everyone in your slack workspace will be able to see messages in these channels. 

Each channel will have its own name. In general, this name will be indicative of the content you will find in this channel. For example, in a channel called "general" you may post, well, general information or announcements. Things that aren't specific to a given topic, but still need to be shared nonetheless. In contrast, a "random" channel will have messages that are random--messages that may not even pertain to the project/organization your Slack team was created for. 

#### Private channels
Private channels are indicated by a sealed padlock to the left of their name. In terms of functionality, they can be used in just the same way as public channels. 

The key difference is that private channels contain a subset of the entire slack workspace members. They are private to only the users that have been invited to that channel. Public channels narrow the entire slack workspace to a specific topic. Private channels do the same, but they limit the amount of people in your workspace who can access the messages for that topic.

#### Joining channels
When you join a slack workspace, you may not be a part of all of its channels, even the public ones. Joining those public channels is very easy though! 

Click on the word `Channels` above where you see all the channels. There you will be able to search for channels by name. 

For example, if you heard some of your classmates discussing the "resources" channel, but you don't see it on your own slack, click on the word channels in your left-hand-side navbar. Type "resources" into the search bar. It will eventually pop up in the suggestes channels as you type. Click on it, and you should be able to join the channel.

### Direct Messages 
Direct messages are an alternative way to communicate on slack. Rather than messaging or reading messages from several people, perhaps you want to message one person, or just a handful of people. direct messages are the best way to do this. direct messages are viewable only to the people who have been messaged. If I send a direct message to Bob, only Bob and I can see that particular message history. 

To send a direct message, click on the `+` sybmol found inside of a small circle next to the words `Direct Messages`. This will also be found in the navbar on the left-hand-side. 

### Threads
Channels and direct messages can easily become cluttered, especially with larger slack teams. When people communicate a lot in one channel, messages sent just 10 minutes ago can easily be backlogged later in the message history. 

Threads help a lot for cleaning this clutter up. They create a sort of sub-message history. As an analogy, think of posts on Facebook as individual messages. Comments on those posts are like threads. Just like you don't immediately see comments on a Facebook posts, you have to click on the thread of a message to be abe to see its history. 

To create a thread, hover over a message until you see a set of icons. When you do, click on the chat bubble. Once you do so, you will be shown an input that, once submitted, will add to a thread for that message. 

### Reactions
Reactions are a good way to acknowledge a message or, well, react to it without words.

Reactions a reactions are just emojis that will be shown below a message when added. To add a reaction to a message, hover on a message, then click on the smily face with a plus on the top right of its face. 

### Tagging
Tagging in slack works very similarly to several social media applications. To tag someone, use the `@` symbol (alternatively to manually typing this, you can click on the `@` symbol found in the input). Once you type in the `@` symbol, you'll be shown a list of names. Continue to type until you find the name you're looking for. 

Tagging will directly notify whoever was tagged. Perhaps I have a question for an entire channel, but I have a feeling Sarah knows the answer. I can post the question in the channel, and then tag Sarah in it. Sarah will be notified immediately because she has been tagged in the message. Of course, this is just one among many uses for tagging others in a message.

You can also tag everyone in a message by using `@channel`. That will tag all members of the channel in the message. Use this sparingly.

### Message Formatting
Slack supports a lot of markdown syntax. If you are familiar with markdown, try to use some in Slack and see what works. 

We'll cover some of the most important message formatting here.

#### Highlighting
To highlight words, enclose them in backticks (\` \`).  `This text is highlighted. It's a note of emphasis in my message I want to make sure people see.`

#### New lines
Messages in slack do not have to be gigantice clumps of words. 

You can create new lines in messages. Obviously, when you hit the enter key, you submit everything you've typed to that point as a message. However, if you hit (on Macs) the `option key` or (on PCs) the `alt key`, you create a new line. 


#### Small code snippets
We will cover code snippets in a bit, but say you want to quickly share just a couple lines of code. Code enclose between two sets of three backticks (\`\`\`) will create code snippets.

For example:

```
var name = "Joe"

name += " Smith"

console.log(name)

```

### Attachments
Attachments are very useful for Slack messages. If you want to upload a photo or zip file (among other things), you can add them ass attachments. Within the input where you would normally type a message, you will find a `+` symbol on the left hand side. Click on it, and you will be given a set of choices of where to upload a file from. Once you select it, Slack will prompt yu to either upload the content immediately, or to add a message along with it. 

### Code Snippets
If you've uploaded a file, or even clicked on the `+` symbol within the input for submitting a message to slack, you may have noticed an option to add a code snippet.

When you click on the `Code or Text` snippet, you will be shown a pop-up window. In that popup window, you can go ahead and paste or just start typing code. By default, Slack will try to autodetect which language is being used. If you'd like to be more explicit, you can go ahead and choose one from the dropdown menu found towards the top of the pop-up.

### Coding Bootcamp Channels

#### _coding-bootcamp
This is the "main" channel. The instructors will post most of the content in this channel. Any class information or files slacked out by instructors can be found here. 

#### general
General is where you should post a message if your message does not fit into any of the other categories, but is still relevant to the class.

#### code-drill-feedback
If you find any issues with the code drills, whether they be typos, unclear instructions, or maybe they're just too hard or too easy, post those concerns in this channel. That way the code drills can be updated and improved for everyone!

#### code-drills
This is a place to ask fellow students about content in the code drills. Perhaps a given topic is still confusing you and you want to understand more about it. This is the place to post any comments or suggestions regarding the code drills directed towards your fellow students.

#### coding-career
This is a place where career services, your Student Success Manager (SSM) will post about career services or career opportunities. Students can also post to this channel with any information or questions relevant to career services and/or opportunities.

#### homework
This channel is used specifically for homework assignments. If you have any insights or questions regarding the current, or even past, assignments, post them here. 

#### professional-outings
This is a place to share any professional/networking events you have heard about or plan on attending. These outings should be related to tech or tech careers.

#### random
As you can gather from the name, this is a channel for random content. Anything you want to share that doesn't fit in any of the other channels, or is just plain silly, should go here. 

#### remote-class
If you are attending class remotely, and would like to post any questions or comments about the remote class, post those here. 

#### resources
Post any resources you find here! If you find any useful libraries, stack overflow posts, tools etc... that you think are worthy of sharing with your classmates, post them here. 

#### social-outings
Want to grab some food after class? Want to invite your classmates to go see a movie? Post those outings here. 

#### study-group
If you'd like to find or organize any study groups for the class, visit this channel. 

#### technical questions
This channel is for technical questions. Note that if your question came from a homework or a code drill, you should probably post it in those channels.

### 0 Channels
The "0-firstName-lastName" channels are private channels. At the beginning of the entire class, you will join one of these channels along with your instructor and the TAs. This is where you will most often communicate with the instructional team.

Additionally, when you start a group project, you will also be invited to one of these channels along with your team members and the insturctional staff.
