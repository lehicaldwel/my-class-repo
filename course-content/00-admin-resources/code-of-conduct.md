## Our Pledge

our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

We are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

We have the right and responsibility to communicate issues that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct to your SSM, TAs or Instructor.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within classroom spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the classroom community for homework or course review or project work. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting your SSM, TAs, or Instructor. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
